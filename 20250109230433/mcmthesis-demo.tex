\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Background}
% 有一半多一点的优秀论文这里会放一张没什么信息量的那种图，
% 因为我们这里包含了旅游业带来的经济增长、环境破坏和居民态度三个部分，
% 不是很好总结，就先没有放图了
Juneau, Alaska, a city with approximately 30,000 residents, has witnesseda dramatic boom in the tourism, which reached a peak of 1.6 million passengersin 2023. 
This influx of vistors has introduced significant economic benefits, generating about \$375 million in revenue for the city. 
However, it has also brought challenges like overcrowding and environmental concerns.

One of the most urgent issues is the rapid recession of Mendenhall Glacier, a premier attraction that has receded by around eight football fields since 2007. 
This retreat is partly attributed to warming temperatures, which are exacerbated by the increased human activity associated with overtourism. 
Moreover, the hidden costs of tourism, including pressure on local infrastructure and an overall increased carbon footprint, poses serious challenges to the environmentally sensitive regions. 
Thought various measures have been taken to ease the burden, like increased hotel taxes, visitor fees and restrictions on alcohol comsumption, no tangible results have yet been seen.

While numerous locals who rely on tourism prefer to see growing number benefit their businesses, many others are frustrated and are either leaving or protesting against the impact of tourists. 
Therefore, how to realize the sustainability of the tourism becomes a great challenge we need to address.

\subsection{Restatement of the Problem}
Considering the background information and restricted conditions identified in the problem statement, we are required to solve the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Problem 1: Model Development} \\
    Develop a model to stabilize Juneau's tourism industry by optimizing income while controlling the carbon footprint, the rate of melting of glaciers. 
    and the social satisfaction. Include a sensitivity analysis to identify the most significant factors.
    
  \item \textbf{Problem 2: Revenue Allocation} \\
    Allocate the expenditures from additional revenue to areas such as infrastructure and environmental protection reasonably so that the social benifits are maxmized.
    
  \item \textbf{Problem 3: Model Adaptability} \\
    Adapt the model to other overtourism-affected tourist destinations, showing how location-specific factors influence measure importance. 
    Use the model establisted above to promote less-visited locations for better balance.
    
  \item \textbf{Problem 4: Memo to Tourist Council} \\
    Draft a one-page memo outlining predictions, the effects of various measures, and suggestions for optimizing outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumption and Justification}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Assumption1:} The data we use are accurate and valid. 
  \item \textbf{Justification1:} Our data is collected from the Juneau government and some other official websites and research papers. 
  It is reasonable to assume that the data are of high quality.

  \item \textbf{Assumption2:} Juneau will remain relatively stable, with no drastic environmental changes or social unrest.
  \item \textbf{Justification2:} A stable natural and social environment provides a predictable framework within which we can build model and make decisions. 
  It is important to note that this assumption does not neglect the potential impact of predictable environmental and social change.
  
  \item \textbf{Assumption3:} The touristsm, locals and the government are rational decision-makers aiming to maximize their own utility and possessing complete logical reasoning abilities.% 因为用了博弈论模型，加上理性人假设
  \item \textbf{Justification3:} This assumption is well-grounded in economic theory. Tourists typically make travel decisions based on cost-benefit analyses\cite{crouch2004determinants}, 
  and local residents engage in tourism-related activities to maximize their benefits\cite{ap1992residents}.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

\section{Dynamic Management Model of Sustainable Tourism Based on Tripartite Game (DMSTM)}
% The overall structure of the model is shown in Fig.X. 需要架构图
We take the effect of the number of tourist $V_t$, the quality of environment $E_t$, 
the retreat of glaciers $G_t$, the stability of society $S$ into consideration , 
and build a game theory based model, DMSTM, to achieve the multi-objective optimization.
DMSTM aims to maxmize the net income from toruism while minizing the carbon footprint,
garbage generating and glacial recession, as well as keep the pressure on infrastructure within some limits,
to provide better decision-making advice.
In order to develop this model, we first need to calibrate the parameters to estimate 
the independent variables $V_t, E_t, G_t, S$ mentioned above.

\subsection{Parameters Calibration}

\subsubsection{The Number of Tourist}
The number of tourist is affected by many factors, such as the number of tourist in the last few years, 
the quality of environment, the construction of infrastructure... To predict the chagne of number of tourist,
we use multiple linear regression method

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Delta V_t}{V_t} = \alpha\cdot\left(\frac{E_t}{E_t+\theta_{E_t}}+\frac{K_t}{K_t+\theta_{K_t}}\right) - \beta\cdot(T_h+T_v) - \gamma\cdot(C_t+F_t) - \lambda\cdot M_t
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \Delta V_t = V_{t+1} - V_t
\end{equation}

where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \lambda$ are the parameters to fit, and they represent 
the coefficient of the environment and infrastructure attraction, the coefficient of the tax and expense restraint,
negative feedback coefficient of environmental pressure and the sensitivity coefficient of glacier melting, respectively.
While $\theta_E$ and $\theta_K$ are the saturation thresholds of environmental quality and infrastructure investment.

\subsubsection{The Environmental Quality}
The Environmental quality is impacted negatively by the carbon footprint, waste emissions, glacial retreating, and 
positively by the environmental quality in the past and the investment in environment protection. With this
insight, we build a dynamic equation to predict the environmental quality

\begin{equation}
  E_{t+1} = E_t + r_E \cdot E_t \left(1 - \frac{E}{E_{\text{max}}}\right) - \gamma_C \cdot C_t - \gamma_F \cdot F_t - \gamma_G \cdot G_t + \eta \cdot E_G
\end{equation}

where $r_E$ is the rate of self-healing of the environment, while $\gamma_C, \gamma_F, \gamma_G$ are the coefficient of 
environmental damage caused by carbon emissions, waste generating and glacial retreat. $\eta$ is the restoration efficiency of 
environmental protection investment, and $E_{max} = 100$ is the upper limit of environmental quality.

Given the complexity of this equation, we use nonlinear least squares method to fit the parameters with 
a reasonable restraint that all parameters are positive.

% In order to describe our process of fitting the parameters to predict the environmental quality more clearly,
% we draw the flowchart Figure X below

\subsubsection{Glacial Retreat}
In our model, the rate of glacial retreat is determined by this rate in the past, the carbon emissions and the number of visitors.
So we construct a linear model

\begin{equation}
  G_t = A \cdot C_t + \mu \cdot V_t + G_0
\end{equation}

and use linear regression to fit the parameters. The intercept $G_0$ is fitted as the value in reference paper, 
while $A$ and $\mu$ are the parameters to learn.

\subsubsection{Social Stability}
We create a score between 0 and 10 to evaluate the social stability, whose basis is mainly from 
the historical social stability score, the amount of tourists, the environmental quality and the extend of glacial retreat.
Therefore, we construct a regression model with constraint

\begin{equation}
  S_t = max\left(0, S_{\text{base}} - \alpha_{v_t} \cdot V_t + \alpha_{E_t} \cdot E_t - \alpha_{M_t} \cdot M_t\right)
\end{equation}

where $S_{\text{base}}$ is a benchmark score, while $\alpha_{v_t}, \alpha_{E_t}, \alpha_{M_t}$ are the parameters to fit 
with elastic network regression.

\subsection{Multi-Objective Optimization}
In multi-objective optimization problem, there are a number of conflicting objective functions. In this case, 
single objective optimization usually can't meet all the requirements, so we need to introduce multi-objective 
optimization method to find a set of compromise solutions to make balance between different goals.

Specialize to this problem, we build a tripartite game based dynamic management model, DMSTM, in which 
we regard the tourists, the locals and the government as rational actors,
and consider several goals, including the net income from tourism, the amount of carbon footprint, 
the amount of waste produced and the rate of glacial retreat. 

Due to the interrelation and potential conflict of the objectives, we use the weight coefficients $w_1, w_2, w_3$ to reflect 
the importance of each objective to the overall strategy. The final objective function can be represented as 

\begin{equation}
  Max \ (w_1 \cdot T_p - w_2 \cdot (C_t + F_t + G_t) - w_3 \cdot K_{I,t})
\end{equation}

where $K_{I,t}=\frac{K_t}{K_{\text{max}}}$ represent the pressure on infrastructure.

Additionally, we add the constraints that $E_t \geq 30$ and $V_t \leq 2.0$ to ensure that
while pursuing the maximizing of tourism income, the social well-being and ecological Sustainability
are guaranteed to some extend.

As for the solution method, we use NSGA-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} algorithm to find
\emph{Pareto Front}, which provides a set of choice of strategies for the decision makers to give consideration to
both economic benefits and social weal as well as environmental protection.

Query1: write a sort algorithm\\
Output: Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a simple implementation of the selection sort algorithm in Python:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
def selection_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[min_idx] > arr[j]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
    return arr
\end{lstlisting}
This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. \href{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/}{The time complexity of this algorithm is O($n^2$)}.

There are many other sorting algorithms available such as bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and more. Each of these algorithms has its own advantages and disadvantages. You can learn more about them on GeeksforGeeks and Programiz.

I hope this helps!

def fft(x):
    n = len(x)
    if n == 1:
        return x
    even = fft(x[0::2])
    odd = fft(x[1::2])
    T = [np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k / n) * odd[k] for k in range(n // 2)]
    return [even[k] + T[k] for k in range(n // 2)] + [even[k] - T[k] for k in range(n // 2)]
\end{lstlisting}
The FFT is a widely used algorithm for computing the \textbf{Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)} of a sequence. It reduces the number of computations needed from O(n$^2$) to O(n log n) 12. The basic idea of the FFT is to apply divide and conquer. We divide the coefficient vector of the polynomial into two vectors, recursively compute the DFT for each of them, and combine the results to compute the DFT of the complete polynomial 3.

I hope this helps!
